	<h1>Lionel Messi’s Issue With Inter Miami Teammates Revealed</h1>
	<p>Inter Miami CF's 4-1 victory against New York Red Bulls in MLS play last Saturday was a breath of fresh air after a crushing 5-1 CONCACAF Champions Cup defeat to Vancouver Whitecaps.The bounce-back win appeared to be a huge relief for everyone in the squad — except captain Lionel Messi.The Argentinian World Cup winner was in a good mood most of the match, most notably when he held off security to graciously allow a pitch invader to snap a photo with him. The Herons went up 3-0 in the first half, and Messi polished off the win when he got his goal in the 67th minute.</p>

    <p>However, soccer is about much more than the scoreline. Messi left the pitch at Chase Stadium against New York looking far from satisfied.In the buildup to IMCF's next MLS match against Minnesota United FC on Saturday, the source of his frustration has been revealed — a problem with his teammates.

Inter Miami head coach Javier Mascherano confirmed that for Messi, the standard of the team was not high enough in the 4-1 win. 

"He’s a competitive beast," Mascherano said of Messi's frustration against Red Bulls. "That’s normal. We know his level of demand, not only with himself but with all around him.”

Former United States Men's National Team forward Hercules Gomez, who attended the match in Fort Lauderdale, added a layer of context on ESPN's "Futbol Americas."

"I was in the stadium for Inter Miami vs NYRB and Messi’s frustration with his teammates was evident," Gomez wrote on X. "Things are quickly coming to a head."

"If (Messi) gives it to one of Messi's friends — (Jordi) Alba, (Sergio) Busquets, Luis Suarez — he knows there's the capacity to return that play to him," Gomez explained. "There's a little more purpose and effort to the run. A lot of times when he gives it to another player, he waits. Because he knows, that's probably not going to get there... You can see Messi frustrated." </p>
